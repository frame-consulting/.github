## DiffFusion.jl

We develop an open source exposure simulation engine for XVA and CCR. Key objectives are computational performance and flexibility in terms of model and product design.

Details about the features are elaborated in the [package documentation](https://frame-consulting.github.io/DiffFusion.jl/dev/pages/overview/).

## QuantLib Quantitative Finance Library

We maintain forks of the open source [QuantLib](https://www.quantlib.org/) library and its interfaces to Python, Excel and other high-level languages.

Our repositories include several additional models which were developed as part of research projects. The additions are rebased on the recent releases of the official repositories.
